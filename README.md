# Predictive-Modeling
A predictive modeling project for an OTT service (ShowTime). This repository contains a linear regression model to identify key factors influencing first-day content viewership, along with an exploratory data analysis of the dataset.

Context
An over-the-top (OTT) media service is a media service offered directly to viewers via the internet. The term is most synonymous with subscription-based video-on-demand services that offer access to film and television content, including existing series acquired from other producers, as well as original content produced specifically for the service. They are typically accessed via websites on personal computers, apps on smartphones and tablets, or televisions with integrated Smart TV platforms.

Presently, OTT services are at a relatively nascent stage and are widely accepted as a trending technology across the globe. With the increasing change in customers' social behavior, which is shifting from traditional subscriptions to broadcasting services and OTT on-demand video and music subscriptions every year, OTT streaming is expected to grow at a very fast pace. The global OTT market size was valued at $121.61 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $1,039.03 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 29.4% from 2020 to 2027. The shift from television to OTT services for entertainment is driven by benefits such as on-demand services, ease of access, and access to better networks and digital connectivity.

With the outbreak of COVID19, OTT services are striving to meet the growing entertainment appetite of viewers, with some platforms already experiencing a 46% increase in consumption and subscriber count as viewers seek fresh content. With innovations and advanced transformations, which will enable the customers to access everything they want in a single space, OTT platforms across the world are expected to increasingly attract subscribers on a concurrent basis.

 

Objective
ShowTime is an OTT service provider and offers a wide variety of content (movies, web shows, etc.) for its users. They want to determine the driver variables for first-day content viewership so that they can take necessary measures to improve the viewership of the content on their platform. Some of the reasons for the decline in viewership of content would be the decline in the number of people coming to the platform, decreased marketing spend, content timing clashes, weekends and holidays, etc. They have hired you as a Data Scientist, shared the data of the current content in their platform, and asked you to analyze the data and come up with a linear regression model to determine the driving factors for first-day viewership.

 

Data Description
The data contains the different factors to analyze for the content. The detailed data dictionary is given below.

Data Dictionary:
visitors: Average number of visitors, in millions, to the platform in the past week
ad_impressions: Number of ad impressions, in millions, across all ad campaigns for the content (running and completed)
major_sports_event: Any major sports event on the day
genre: Genre of the content
dayofweek: Day of the release of the content
season: Season of the release of the content
views_trailer: Number of views, in millions, of the content trailer
views_content: Number of first-day views, in millions, of the content
 

Important Note
The following questions need to be answered as a part of the EDA section of the project:

What does the distribution of content views look like?
What does the distribution of genres look like?
The day of the week on which content is released generally plays a key role in the viewership. How does the viewership vary with the day of release?
How does the viewership vary with the season of release?
What is the correlation between trailer views and content views?
